        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We founded Salmon Cookies because our instructor told us to. We were tasked with creating the most disgusting thing in the world, made from 2 wonderful things. So we set out to find things that were widely appreciated, and our first though? <strong>Cookies.</strong> Then we thought about what would go horribly in a cookie, but was normally loved as it's meant to be had. <strong>Fish.</strong> Then we found the most popular fish in most restaurants is Salmon. So we went with it. Now, we have <strong>Salmon Cookies.</strong>
        </p><p>
          So we created the worst idea in the world. Now what? Well, of course we have to advertise. So that's where <strong>you</strong> are. You're at the advertising stage. Next comes the sales phase. We have some testers out there, some shops in various places around the world where seafood is popular: <strong>Seattle, Tokyo, Dubai, Paris, and Lima.</strong>
        </p><p>
          If our test shops go well in those places, then I suppose we'll probably roll out to non-seafood areas, starting with big cities in America. Probably go to <strong>Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Austin, Las Vegas.</strong> We're all super excited here about being able to start this new business with the worst idea in the world, and we hope you're excited too!

        <h2>What are Salmon Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Salmon Cookies are exactly what they sound - cookies made with Salmon. Everybody knows <strong>chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin, sugar cookies.</strong> They all get their sweetness from something. Well <strong>Salmon</strong> is sweet too. So... why not?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, we created it as a joke at first. But we had somebody on our team <strong>determined</strong> to make them taste good. She already enjoyed baking, she knew I (among others) loved cookies. So we went with it. Here we are, 7 months later, and we made some dang good cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting off just as a normal cookie, you get flour, eggs, butter, baking soda, brown sugar, the works. The kicker is when you add the Salmon. The key to balance the Salmon flavor is <strong>molasses.</strong> Molasses is a good binder for the Salmon, gives the cookie a good color, and all around just good added flavor to really challenge your taste buds and what you think you know about food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it comes to the cooking them. We like to make them into <strong>fish shapes,</strong> so we normally just bake an entire sheet of cookies at a time, then we have a big cutting sheet that has <strong>minimal waste</strong> and a bunch of mirrored fish. That way, we can create lots of fish shapes with a wonderful cookie, then frost them however!
